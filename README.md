This repository contains the pymaceuticals code and a data folder with the csv file used to perform the analysis.
Most of the code was developped based on the exercises seen and completed in the week 5 of the bootcamp. 
In addition, I have looked for examples of code in Copilot and Stackoverflow.
The conclusions of the analysis are included at the top of the code.
